MyJavaScript code helps one to manage a shopping list. It allows users to add items, mark items as purchased, and clear the list. The list is dynamically updated in the web page as the user interacts with it.

Both JavaSript, HTML and CSS have been utelised

Java script through let items initializes an empty array to store the list items.

The save Item function saves a new item to the list. It creates an object representing the item and adds it to the beginning of the items array, then updates the display.

code 63 to 68 on JavaScript sets up an event listener for the form submission. When the form is submitted, it gets the item name from the input field, prevents the form from submitting the usual way, and saves the new item to the list.
